descriptions = {
    "Number of Nodes (Cities):": "Specifies how many cities are included in the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). More cities increase the problem's complexity.",
    "Max Iterations:": "Sets how many times the algorithm will try to improve the solution. Higher values can lead to better results but increase runtime.",

    "Alpha (ACO):": "Determines how strongly ants follow existing pheromone trails. Higher values make ants prefer previously discovered paths.",
    "Beta (ACO):": "Controls how much ants rely on visible distance (heuristic information). A high beta means ants prefer shorter paths.",
    "Evaporation Rate (ACO):": "Regulates how quickly pheromones fade. Helps balance exploration and exploitation by preventing early convergence on suboptimal paths.",

    "Number of Particles (PSO):": "Sets how many candidate solutions (particles) explore the search space. More particles increase coverage but require more computation.",
    "Inertia Weight (w - PSO):": "Controls momentum: higher values encourage exploration, lower values focus on refining current paths.",
    "Cognitive Coefficient (c1 - PSO):": "Defines how much each particle is influenced by its own past best solution (self-learning).",
    "Social Coefficient (c2 - PSO):": "Defines how much each particle is influenced by the best solution found by others (swarm intelligence).",

    "Population Size (GA):": "Specifies the number of potential solutions (individuals) in each generation. Larger populations offer more diversity.",
    "Generations (GA):": "Sets how many evolutionary cycles will occur. More generations allow the algorithm to refine better solutions.",
    "Mutation Rate (GA):": "Probability that random changes will be introduced in offspring. Encourages diversity and helps escape local optima.",
